PM (Sarah):
Thank you all for joining today. The focus of this meeting is to outline the initial requirements for our new project—a Customer Feedback Management System. This tool is meant to help businesses collect, analyze, and act on customer feedback more effectively. Let’s start with a quick overview of the goals for this project. Laura, can you share the business perspective?

MM (Laura):
Sure. From the business standpoint, our goal is to create a platform that makes it easy for companies to centralize customer feedback. It should allow them to identify trends, pinpoint common issues, and act quickly on customer concerns. One of our key objectives is to offer real-time sentiment analysis to help businesses respond to issues before they escalate.

PM (Sarah):
Got it. Real-time sentiment analysis sounds like a critical feature. John, from a development perspective, what do you foresee as the main challenges for building this system?

LD (John):
The sentiment analysis will likely require integrating with machine learning APIs or developing a custom NLP model. We also need to consider scalability since businesses might collect feedback from millions of customers. Another concern is ensuring that the platform can integrate seamlessly with tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and existing CRM systems.

PM (Sarah):
Thanks, John. Emily, from a design standpoint, what are the key considerations to keep in mind for the user interface?

UXD (Emily):
The user interface needs to be intuitive, especially for non-technical users. I’m thinking about a dashboard that provides clear visualizations—things like heatmaps for trends, graphs for sentiment over time, and actionable insights. Also, users should be able to customize their views. Accessibility is another priority, so we need to design with WCAG guidelines in mind.

PM (Sarah):
Good point. Michael, what are the testing challenges you anticipate for this project?

QA (Michael):
Testing the accuracy of sentiment analysis will be tricky. We’ll need to validate it against a variety of datasets to ensure it’s not biased. Also, since the system integrates with multiple platforms, we’ll have to test compatibility across different environments. Performance testing will also be essential to ensure the system can handle large data volumes.

PM (Sarah):
Great insights, everyone. Let’s move on to some specific requirements. Laura, can you list the top three features you believe are non-negotiable for this product?

MM (Laura):
Sure:
1.	Sentiment Analysis Dashboard—Displays real-time sentiment trends.
2.	Automated Alerts—Businesses should receive notifications for negative trends or spikes in complaints.
3.	Integration Capabilities—It should work with popular CRMs and messaging platforms.

PM (Sarah):
Emily, any additional suggestions from a design perspective?

UXD (Emily):
I’d add a feedback categorization feature—users should be able to tag feedback as “Bug,” “Feature Request,” or “Compliment.” Also, we need a search function so users can quickly find specific feedback.

PM (Sarah):
John, do you see any technical risks with these requirements?

LD (John):
The integration capabilities could get complicated, especially if APIs of third-party tools are updated. Also, real-time sentiment analysis might require significant computational resources, so we’ll need to balance performance and cost.

PM (Sarah):
Understood. Before we wrap up, let’s identify the next steps. Michael, can you draft a preliminary test plan? John, can you work on a high-level architecture proposal? And Emily, can you create wireframes for the dashboard?

QA (Michael):
Sure, I’ll start with the test plan and include scenarios for sentiment accuracy and performance.

LD (John):
I’ll put together an architecture proposal by next week, focusing on the integration and sentiment analysis components.

UXD (Emily):
I’ll deliver initial wireframes in two weeks. I’ll focus on the dashboard and feedback categorization UI.

PM (Sarah):
Perfect. Let’s regroup in two weeks to review progress. Thanks, everyone!
